A while back as a birthday present for my sister, I made a real life treasure hunt. The theme of this hunt was for a ring of power from Lord of the Rings. 

To test out the hunt I built a web version of the hunt using [Ink and Inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/). It's quite similar to, and was inspired by, my other treasure hunt, [Champlain's Treasure]({{< relref "champlains-treasure" >}} "About Us"). 


You can find the digital version of A Lost Ring [here](https://smalltimegames.github.io/a-lost-ring/).
