A while back I made a treasure hunt for a friend to solve. This involved hiding random clues around their house and leading them from one clue to another. While I was making the hunt, I found myself wanting to test it out without remaking physical clues all the time.

I decided to use [Ink and Inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/) to help me create a digital version of the hunt - a proof of concept. With Ink I was able to test for coherency and see if it would be fun. The difficulty was another story because it's easy to solve the hunt when dealing with multiple choice.

You can find the digital version [here](https://smalltimegames.github.io/champlains-treasure/).
