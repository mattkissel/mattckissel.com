I have released my website [GaijinSensei.com](https://gaijinsensei.com), a repository of English teaching and learning materials. It's still a work in progress and the framework it is built on, [Zensical](https://zensical.org/),  is still in alpha.

Feel free to check it out as I slowly but surely add and reorganize the content posted there.
