    <p>A while back as a birthday present for my sister, I made a real life treasure hunt. The theme of this hunt was for a ring of power from Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>To test out the hunt I built a web version of the hunt using <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/">Ink and Inky</a>. It&rsquo;s quite similar to, and was inspired by, my other treasure hunt, <a href="/posts/games/champlains-treasure/" title="About Us">Champlain&rsquo;s Treasure</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the digital version of A Lost Ring <a href="https://smalltimegames.github.io/a-lost-ring/">here</a>.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/games/champlains-treasure/">Champlains Treasure</a></h2>
    <p>A while back I made a treasure hunt for a friend to solve. This involved hiding random clues around their house and leading them from one clue to another. While I was making the hunt, I found myself wanting to test it out without remaking physical clues all the time.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/">Ink and Inky</a> to help me create a digital version of the hunt - a proof of concept. With Ink I was able to test for coherency and see if it would be fun. The difficulty was another story because it&rsquo;s easy to solve the hunt when dealing with multiple choice.</p>
